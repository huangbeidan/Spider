She will direct our website monitoring work and research into important changes to federal websites. Through leading the production of website monitoring reports, she will drive WIP\u2019s effort to document and reveal important changes in access to public information.\nSarah also adds an extra flare to the team with her Australian accent. So what motivates an Aussie to work on a project that aims to hold the U.S. government accountable for the information it presents on its websites? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about Sarah to help answer that question.\nHometown: I spent much of my childhood in remote parts of Australia many hours from the nearest town or city, but as a college student I adopted Adelaide as my hometown. Adelaide is remarkably unremarkable, a clean quiet city of about a million in the south of the country.\nThing you miss the most about Australia: Definitely the availability of cheap and high quality fresh food, like mandarins, birds eye chilis, and laksa mint. But, you get used to the differences.\nThing you like the most about the US: The people. I love that people care so much, about things generally, but in particular about their politics and government. I\u2019ve met so many passionate people across the country who care deeply about proper governance and policy.  Even those who claim not to care about politics or are cynical about politicians and the government still have an opinion about all things government, which they tend to enthusiastically share upon hearing my pronunciation of tomato.\nWould you rather never eat vegemite again or eat it every day for the rest of your life: EVERY DAY! (And oftentimes in the office. Don\u2019t worry colleagues, you\u2019ll get used to the smell.)\nFavorite American slang word: Pie. It\u2019s not really a slang word, per se. But in the U.S. pies can be pizzas or sweet, but they cannot be pies in the Australian sense (savory with meat or vegetables). Or boondoggle. I remember when the Australian Opposition Leader Kim Beazley used the word \u201Cboondoggle\u201D in a critique of the government\u2019s policies. It caused an outcry amongst people disappointed at the Americanisation [sic] of Australian English.\nPolitical science PhD dissertation topic: 1970s campaign finance reform efforts in Australia, Canada, and the United States. It was an archival study of how political parties approached reform at a time in history when existing campaign finance laws were totally outdated and harked back to the era when the main corruption concerns were about candidates bribing voters with meat and booze rather than candidates being influenced by large campaign contributions.\nTop reason for joining WIP: There are many reasons, including a desire to work with the amazing and passionate people at Sunlight. A major reason is to help preserve one of the things that I find most unique about the United States \u2014 the transparency of its government \u2014 at a time when it seems to be under threat.  \nResearch area you\u2019re most excited to explore with WIP: In terms of the areas we\u2019re already monitoring, I\u2019m excited at the prospect of learning more about health policy, which seems impossibly complicated. In the future, and harking back to my political science roots, I\u2019m hoping to explore issues relating to the federal role in election administration.\nKeep up with Sarah\u2019s and the WIP team\u2019s efforts to assess the state of government websites: sign up for the WIP mailing list , or follow us on Twitter .\nCategorized in: Web Integrity Project\nShare This:\nWeb Integrity Project\nHome\nWebsite Monitoring\nWeb Governance Policy\nFor Journalists\nPublications\nGet Involved\nAbout WIP\nSubscribe\nBecome a part of the open government community and stay up to date with what's going on by signing up!\nContact Us\n1440 G Street NW\nWashington , DC\n20005\n202-742-1520\nCall with Skype\nContact\nAbout Us\nJobs\nFacebook\nTwitter\nFlickr\nInstagram\nTumblr\nYouTube\nPrivacy\nOur privacy policy details how personally identifiable information that is collected on our web sites is handled.

The story includes an update saying just 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the state\u2019s voter rolls in 2012.\nOn Nov. 12, Trump Jr. tweeted the \u201CAmazing, but not shocking at all anymore\u201D headline from an NBC Miami story that said, \u201CNearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens.\u201D But an editor\u2019s note posted to the top of the story before he tweeted about it made clear that the figure from state officials turned out to be deeply flawed.\nAmazing, but not shocking at all anymore. Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens https:\/\/t.co\/8HiObPLeeM via @nbc6\n\u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 12, 2018\nThe story, written by the Associated Press, originates with an effort by Republican Gov. Rick Scott to direct state officials to search out noncitizens on Florida\u2019s voter rolls, and to purge them prior to the 2012 elections. (Scott is now locked in a razor-close race to unseat Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson.) Using a state database of driver\u2019s licenses, the state initially came up with a list of about 180,000 names of people on the state\u2019s voting rolls who might not be citizens. Noncitizens are not legally allowed to vote in federal elections.\nThat was the basis for the headline in the May 11, 2012, story posted on the NBC Miami website, \u201C2012 Election: Nearly 200,000 Voters May Not Be Citizens.\u201D\nBut readers of Trump Jr.\u2019s tweet only need to  click on the link  he included to see the editor\u2019s note explaining how that number turned out to be wildly off.\nNBC Miami,  Editor\u2019s note on Nov. 12, 2018: This story was published in May 2012.\nThe initial list of 180,000 names was whittled to 2,625, according to the Florida Department of State. The state then checked a federal database and stated it found 207 noncitizens on the rolls (not necessarily voting but on the rolls). That list was sent to county election supervisors to check and it also turned out to contain errors. An Aug. 1, 2012, state elections document showed only 85 noncitizens were ultimately removed from the rolls out of a total of about 12 million voters at that time.\nThe original list from state officials was rife with errors. One major flaw: The driver\u2019s license database didn\u2019t include when legal residents later became citizens.\nThe list sparked a 2012 l awsuit . Two of the plaintiffs, Karla Arcia, a Nicaraguan immigrant, and Melande Antoine, who is a Haitian American, found themselves on the list even though both are naturalized citizens who were eligible to vote in the 2012 elections.\nAs the original NBC Miami story explains, the initial list of about 180,000 names was later reduced to about 2,600 (which turned out to include an American war veteran). That list was later pared to 207 when checked against a federal database. County elections supervisors found errors in that list too, and when PolitiFact Florida in 2013 asked the division of elections for data, it provided a list of just 85 \u201Cnoncitizens\u201D ultimately removed from voter rolls. (It was unclear how many of those people may have actually voted illegally.)\n\u201CIt was sloppy, it was slapdash and it was inaccurate,\u201D said Polk County Supervisor of Elections Lori Edwards in 2013 of the original list of 180,000 names . \u201CThey were sending us names of people to remove because they were born in Puerto Rico. It was disgusting.\u201D\nThe Scott administration  scrapped  plans in 2014 to revive efforts to purge noncitizens from voter rolls.\n\u201CWhat we have seen from past efforts is that it has not been successful in identifying ineligible voters,\u201D Deirdre Macnab, president of the Florida League of Voters, said at the time.\nAs we have written, President Donald Trump has repeatedly complained about widespread illegal voting by noncitizens, citing a disputed study and  warning just prior to the 2016 president election that their votes could swing the outcome of his race. The president has cited research by Old Dominion University Professors Jesse Richman and David Earnest, who extrapolated data from a national election survey in which some people self-identified as noncitizens, but indicated that they voted. They estimated somewhere between 38,000 and 2.8 million noncitizens voted illegally in 2008.\nBut as we wrote, that study has been strongly challenged by other academics, including the managers of the database from which the study drew. Stephen Ansolabehere of Harvard and the principal investigator of the voter database told us the findings about noncitizen voters were likely \u201Centirely due to measurement error\u201D \u2014 people who accidentally check the wrong box in surveys. The Washington Post \u2018s \u201CMonkey Cage\u201D blog, which published an article by the Old Dominion professors about their research, later linked to three rebuttals of it.\nThe Old Dominion research was highlighted by Republican Kris Kobach \u2014 the Kansas secretary of state who recently lost  a race to be the state\u2019s governor \u2014 in a federal court case in Kansas City earlier this year that sought to prove rampant illegal voting by noncitizens. According to an in-depth Pro Publica story on the trial, the judge in the case, Julie Robinson, called the conclusions of the study \u201Cconfusing, inconsistent and methodologically flawed.\u201D Robinson found \u201Cno credible evidence that a substantial number of noncitizens registered to vote\u201D in Kansas.\nTrump tapped Kobach to be vice chairman of the since-disbanded\nPresidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity  \u2014 which was to examine \u201Cfraudulent voting,\u201D among other issues. The commission was   dissolved   just months after it was created, and there has been no evidence to date of widespread fraud.\nTo be sure, there have been some cases of noncitizens voting illegally. As we wrote previously, a 2015 report  from the conservative Heritage Foundation documented fewer than a dozen individual cases of noncitizens convicted of registering or actually voting since 2000. And in Texas, a city councilwoman, was sentenced in 2007 to five years in prison for registering noncitizens to vote.\nBut such cases are rare, experts told us.  Sarah Pierce , an associate policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, said there\u2019s very little evidence of it, in part because the disincentives are enormous. It is illegal for an unauthorized immigrant to vote, and it is a deportable offense that makes a person permanently inadmissible for return to the U.S., she said.\nShare the Facts\n2018-11-14 23:08:30 UTC\nFactCheck.org\n7\n1\n11\nFactCheck.org Rating:\nFalse\n\"Amazing, but not shocking at all anymore.

The issue dates back to the 2016 campaign, when Trump, unlike e very other major party candidate for president since 1980,  declined to make his returns public.\nIn the Nov. 7 press conference, Trump reiterated that  he wouldn\u2019t release his tax returns because they were under audit. He said \u201Cyou get far more\u201D from the  legally required financial disclosure forms he had filed \u201Cthan you could ever get from a tax return.\u201D But such forms don\u2019t reveal effective tax rates, charitable giving and how the president complies with, or benefits from, tax laws.\nJoseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax Analysts\u2019   Tax History Project , told us the  financial disclosure form, which includes assets and liabilities, does a better job of showing net worth, but it has \u201Cno information about the president\u2019s tax behavior,\u201D including a \u201Csense of how he structured his businesses to minimize his taxes.\u201D\nTrump also wrongly claimed, \u201CNobody turns over a return when it\u2019s under audit, okay?\u201D Richard Nixon did when he was president.\nIn the midst of a tax scandal in late 1973, the IRS reopened an audit of Nixon\u2019s returns. And during that audit, the White House released tax returns for several years, according to a paper on the issue by Thorndike.\nAlso,   most presidents   since the 1970s have released their tax returns publicly despite the fact that presidents and vice presidents are automatically subject to annual IRS audits,   according to the Internal Revenue Manual .\nFor more on this issue, see our Nov. 9 story \u201C The President\u2019s Tax Returns .\u201D And for previous videos in our collaboration with Tapper and CNN\u2019s \u201CState of the Union,\u201D  p lease see  our website.\nCategories\nState of the Union with Jake Tapper\nThe Wire\nTags\nState of the Union with Jake Tapper\nIssue\ntax returns\nTaxes\nPeople\nDonald Trump\nPrevious Story California Shooting Prompts \u2018Crisis Actor\u2019 Conspiracy\nNext Story Trump Jr.\u2019s False Noncitizen Voting Tweet\nAsk FactCheck\nQ: Did Christine Blasey Ford recant her accusations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh?\nA: No. Comments by President Trump may have left that impression.

The lawsuit specifically notes that the president and White House officials have shown animus toward the media in general, and CNN and Acosta in particular. In response, the president\u2019s lawyers have claimed the White House has not demonstrated the type of content and viewpoint discrimination that is impermissible under the First Amendment. The evidence indicates otherwise. \nThroughout the first year of his presidency, Trump and his administration attacked various media outlets and journalists more than 400 times, specifically targeting CNN verbally and on Twitter dozens of times. The attacks on the media didn\u2019t let up in 2018. These facts and the 42 examples of the Trump administration\u2019s attacks on Acosta and CNN gathered below support the network's complaint that the Trump administration took action against Acosta and CNN for the \u201Ccontents of their reporting\u201D:\nTrump: \u201CJim Acosta is a very unprofessional man. \u2026 I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a smart person.\u201D [Faceba.se, 11\/9\/18 ]\nTrump: \u201CSo funny to see the CNN Fake Suppression Polls and false rhetoric.\u201D [Twitter, 11\/5\/18 ]\nTrump: \u201CCNN and others in the Fake News Business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that I said the \u2018Media is the Enemy of the People.\u2019 Wrong!\u201D [Twitter, 10\/29\/18 ]\nTrump: \u201CFacebook has just stated that they are setting up a system to \u2018purge\u2019 themselves of Fake News.

Here\u2019s what you need to know about him.\nBlog \u203A\u203A\u203A November 14, 2018 6:04 PM EST \u203A\u203A\u203A CRISTINA LóPEZ G.\nMelissa Joskow \/ Media Matters\nJack Posobiec, a conspiracy theorist and consummate pro-Trump media figure who often boasts of his access to the White House and other MAGA celebrities, worked as recently as 2017 with white supremacists who advocate for violence. Posobiec has a long record of extremism and ratfucking: He was an outspoken advocate of the \u201Calt-right,\u201D published a book with the help of an \u201Calt-right\u201D figure, and pushed all kinds of smears and misinformation for political gain.\nPosobiec reportedly had links to Jeffrey and Edward Clark, two white supremacist brothers. Jeffrey Clark was arrested by federal authorities in Washington, D.C. for gun charges after relatives contacted authorities about his support for last month\u2019s mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue. As reported by HuffPost , Posobiec teamed up with the brothers in 2017 to film documentary footage; a source provided an image of Posobiec alongside the brothers. HuffPost also reported that anti-fascist researcher Laura Sennett said Jeffrey Clark had told her Posobiec both knew of his Nazi beliefs and was sympathetic to them.\nPosobiec is currently a host for One America News Network, a right-wing news outlet that specializes in sycophantic\ncoverage of President Donald Trump and conspiracy theories . He previously worked for far-right Canadian outlet Rebel Media. Posobiec achieved his standing in the MAGA media universe by embracing the \u201C alt-right\u201C and its public figures during the 2016 presidential election, and, like many other grifters , eventually rebranding as a member of the \u201CNew Right\u201D after the extremism of the \u201Calt-right\u201D made associating with it too toxic.\nDespite his continued efforts to sanitize his role in spreading the \u201CPizzagate\u201D conspiracy theory, Posobiec repeatedly broadcasted to his social media followers and to Infowars audiences the baseless claim that a D.C. pizza restaurant served as a front for a child trafficking ring, showed up at the pizza parlor himself to \u201Cinvestigate,\u201D and then claimed that the arrest of a gunman who also showed up at the pizzeria was a \u201C false flag .\u201D\nPosobiec\u2019s ratfucking record includes spreading forged documents tied to Russia purporting to be then-French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron\u2019s emails; planting a \u201CRape Melania\u201D sign at an anti-Trump protest to smear activists; and doxxing one of the women who reported that she was sexually assaulted as a minor by defeated Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore. Leading up to the 2018 midterm elections, Posobiec was an administrator in a racist Facebook group that promoted Republican candidates and pushed far-right conspiracy theories.\nHe has built his brand by promoting attention-grabbing stunts that masquerade as activism, such as disrupting a theater presentation of William Shakespeare\u2019s Julius Caesar that he deemed to promote political violence, filing a civil rights lawsuit over all-female screenings of Wonder Woman , and trolling a congressional press conference on net neutrality to demand that Democratic senators disavow \u201Csatanic\u201D internet pornography. He also gleefully participated in an online harassment campaign that resulted in CNN journalist Andrew Kaczynski receiving death threats.\nPosobiec has ridden every controversy and subsequent media coverage to increase his visibility and online followers. He\u2019s used that branding for political access and promotion of his personal business endeavors, which include his self-congratulatory book about the movement that took Trump to victory, and his most recent book, published with the help of  with \u201Calt-right\u201D figure Theodore Beale, who writes under the pseudonym Vox Day. Posobiec promoted this book by linking to Vox Day\u2019s website, a depository of white supremacist grievances.\nPosobiec\u2019s clout in the MAGA social universe has risen high enough to earn him a retweet from Trump himself (when Posobiec wrote an accusatory tweet aimed at the media for focusing too much on the 2017 white supremacist \u201CUnite the Right\u201D rally in Charlottesville, VA) and allow him access to the White House. He used temporary White House press credentials in May 2017 to push the debunked conspiracy theory that former Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered for leaking DNC emails.\nIn his role as OANN correspondent, Posobiec regularly showcases his access to pro-Trump\ncelebrities (including Donald Trump Jr. ) and his presence at White House and Trump Hotel\nsocial functions . Meanwhile, he\u2019s used his OANN platform to hype smears from the defendant in the Seth Rich lawsuit, as well amplify the wild conspiracy theory known as QAnon, giving virulent far-right troll Microchip a platform and taking his word at face value that he is the anonymous poster known as Q. Microchip is an anonymous and prolific user of Gab -- the social media site known for being \u201Chaven for white supremacists\u201D -- where he constantly posts white supremacist grievances , anti-Semitic and racial slurs , and invites followers to \u201Cfuck shit up\u201D legally by pushing and spreading the misinformation campaign that is QAnon.\nIt is clear that Posobiec\u2019s history of extremism, peddling of conspiracy theories, and ties to white supremacists are not a problem for the network that employs him, nor for the pro-Trump universe that has enabled his professional career. In that universe, misinformation and extremism are not deal breakers. They\u2019re assets.\nThe fatal police shooting of Jemel Roberson disproves the NRA\u2019s favorite myth\nNRATV struggled to not admit the obvious\nBlog \u203A\u203A\u203A November 14, 2018 5:31 PM EST \u203A\u203A\u203A CYDNEY HARGIS\nThe fatal police shooting of an armed and trained security guard outside a bar, after he stopped a gunman from opening fire, provides further proof that the \u201C good guy with a gun \u201D myth peddled by NRATV is just that: a myth.\nOn November 11 , 26-year-old security guard Jemel Roberson \u201Capprehended an alleged gunman\u201D outside an Illinois bar, holding him on the ground at gunpoint until police arrived. According to witnesses, bar patrons were yelling to officers that Roberson was security, while officers demanded he drop his firearm before fatally shooting him. An investigation is underway.\nThe National Rifle Association and its media outlet have long peddled the narrative\nthat the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun and they have frequently suggested that the victims of mass shootings could have saved themselves had they been armed . During the November 13 edition of NRATV\u2019s Relentless , NRA spokesperson and host Dana Loesch referred to Roberson as \u201Ca good guy with a gun, one of those individuals that anti-gun advocates love to pretend do not exist.\u201D\nLoesch admitted the incident made her \u201Cworry a little bit\u201D as a concealed carrier, and she questioned what good guys should do when they\u2019re \u201Cthat close\u201D to the gunman \u201Cand law enforcement shows up.\u201D NRA-certified instructor and frequent NRATV guest Guy Relford responded that there is \u201Cno perfect choice\u201D between exposing \u201Cyourself to the risk of the known bad guy who is underneath you that you\u2019re holding, or exposing yourself to the risk of being shot by police officers\u201D:\nDANA LOESCH (HOST): I worry about this as, you know, a concealed carrier, I worry about this as someone who -- you know, I\u2019ve done a lot of training, and I always make sure that I have my skills up to speed if heaven forbid, you know, I\u2019d rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it in that situation. But I\u2019ll be frank with you, stories like this make me worry a little bit. And not just for -- you know, for all Americans, Black Americans, white Americans, men and women, because this is one of the -- I think, one of the concerns that concealed carry holders have. So, how should concealed carriers look at this particular story and -- because, again, it makes me worried and if I\u2019m feeling a little nervous about this, I would imagine other people are too.\n\u2026\nGUY RELFORD: If you can possibly avoid it, you do not want to have a gun in your hand when responding police officers show up, even if you\u2019re the good guy. Now, here, he\u2019s holding someone, you know, against their will. Did he have the ability to put that gun away or not have that gun in his hand or get that gun back in the holster before police officers arrived? And again, I don\u2019t want to second-guess anyone without having more facts, but if there was any opportunity to get that gun out of his hand, not in the sight of police officers when they show up, we always want to try to do that because unfortunately this isn\u2019t the first time that someone survived a potentially deadly attack and was completely lawful in what they did, but lost their life because of confusion by responding police officers.\nLOESCH: I am so glad that you brought that up, Guy, because in all of these -- and I\u2019m sure that you can talk a little bit about this, last question for you, in some of the cases that you\u2019ve handled, because normally in everything that I\u2019ve read, whenever there\u2019s been a defensive gun usage and someone is holding someone, there\u2019s some distance there. You know, there\u2019s at least five to three feet between the individuals. This -- I mean Roberson was on this guy, he had his knee on his back, and that makes it a little bit harder for him if this -- and who knows if this guy still -- we don\u2019t even know if this guy still -- the criminal still had his gun in his hand. We don\u2019t know that either. And then police show up -- you don\u2019t really have a lot of time to make sure you\u2019re in a safe position. If that criminal can access that firearm immediately, you kind of -- so, I don\u2019t want to speculate, but at the same time, it\u2019s such a rare instance, it\u2019s a very difficult spot for anybody to be in when they\u2019re doing the right thing. I mean, he was a security guard, he wanted to be on the police force, he had some training, so he knew what he was doing up until a certain extent. That gets into a real kind of gray area, what do you do when you\u2019re that close and law enforcement shows up and maybe the perp still has his hand on the gun?\nRELFORD: Yes, and sometimes there may just be no good decision. I mean, there is no perfect choice between choosing whether you\u2019re going to expose yourself to the risk of the known bad guy who is underneath you that you\u2019re holding, or exposing yourself to the risk of being shot by police officers.\nEven though NRATV continually pushes the \u201Cgood guy\u201D narrative, statistics and anecdotal commentary from law enforcement repeatedly prove armed citizens rarely stop mass shootings or violent crime incidents.

The one-sided discussion began when Cuomo Prime Time host Chris Cuomo tossed to CNN Tonight  Don Lemon, host of the next show, CNN Tonight , and by the end of the segment, Cuomo mocked those who'd raise questions about their viewpoints, stating that they would paint the two as \u201CBonnie and Clyde of Fake News.\u201D\nVIDEO\nGeorgia Hysteria: CNN\u2019s Ryan Declares Voting Rights Don\u2019t Exist Anymore\nBy Nicholas Fondacaro | November 7, 2018 3:21 AM EST\nDespite the fact that Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp held a lead outside the threshold needed for a runoff, Democrats and the liberal media were not conceding the state\u2019s gubernatorial election.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook .)\nWhile we found that several candidates Obama supported on the campaign trail did indeed lose, it certainly wasn\u2019t all of them.\nObama endorsed more than 300 Democratic candidates in federal and state races across the country, according to National Public Radio.\nBecause the Facebook post specifically says \"campaigned,\" those are the races we will focus on.\nFrom what we could find, the former president traveled around the U.S. and campaigned for dozens of candidates.\nWhile some experienced losses, many also experienced wins; such as Jacky Rosen , who won a Senate seat in Nevada; Tony Evers , who won the governorship in Wisconsin and Sen. Tim Kaine , who won re-election in Virginia.\nThe post cites and quotes an opinion story from the Washington Examiner. However, nowhere in that story does it say that \"all\" the candidates Obama stumped for lost.\nBut it did highlight three: Andrew Gillum, Sen. Bill Nelson and Stacey Abrams.\nBut even those losses are far from set in stone. We'll explain.\nRecounts and runoffs\nIn Florida, a state known for razor-thin election margins, several recounts are underway including for Gillum and Nelson.\nOn election night, Gillum was trailing Republican Ron DeSantis in the race for governor by 77,377 votes when he called DeSantis to congratulate him. But the votes were still being counted. Similarly, Nelson, the Democratic incumbent, was trailing Republican Gov. Rick Scott by a small margin when Scott declared victory just after midnight. Again, the votes were still being counted.\nBy Friday, Nov. 10, with unofficial election results finally in from every Florida county, the Democratic candidates in both races were behind by very small counts: DeSantis was leading Gillum by 0.41 percent, or 33,684 votes; and Scott was leading Nelson in the Senate race by 0.15 percent, or 12,562 votes.\nThat\u2019s when Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner ordered a statewide machine recount of over 8.2 million ballots in races for three races, including U.S. Senate and governor.\nFlorida law requires an automatic machine recount in any race where the margin of victory is within one half of one percentage point.\nIn Georgia, it\u2019s not quite as close, but Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is not conceding. Republican challenger Brian Kemp, who had been the Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State for eight years leading up through last week\u2019s election, resigned his position overseeing the state\u2019s elections on Nov. 8, two days after Election Day, when it became clear his margin of victory could be small enough as to force a runoff.\nBy Monday night, unofficial returns showed that Kemp was leading by about 58,000 votes.\nBut questions about the state\u2019s handling of provisional ballots and voter registration system led a federal judge to order a delay in certifying the results until officials conduct a formal review of those issues.\nOur ruling\nA Facebook post claims that every candidate Obama hit the campaign trail for lost in Tuesday\u2019s election.\nThat\u2019s just plain wrong.\nObama did rally for Democratic candidates who ended up losing, but the same goes for several others he supported who won their races.\nWe rate this claim False.\nx\nTHE FACTS\nDelivered to your inbox weekly\nEmail Address\nSIGN UP\nx\nI would like to contribute $\nPer Month\nPer Year\nOne Time\nThis donation will make you a Inside Voice member.\nJoin Now\nFor Membership benefits click here\n"}]}

(AP)\nFlorida\u2019s midterm recount has both parties furiously filing litigation, making the rounds on national TV, firing off attacks on Twitter and pleading for donations to fund their fights for U.S. Senate and the governor\u2019s mansion.\nPractically everyone seems mad at Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, who has been accused of corruption or incompetence as her county tabulated ballots slower than nearly every other county in the state.\nThe fast-moving situation creates an atmosphere rife for misinformation. PolitiFact is here to help voters sort out the facts from fiction.\nHas there been fraud in the ballot counting in Broward County?\nGov. Rick Scott and President Donald Trump have alleged fraud in the ballot counting in Broward County, a liberal bastion. The issue is important to Scott, whose political future hangs on a narrow lead of thousands of votes over incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson.\nNeither Republican provided any evidence of fraud. While Broward has a history of lawsuits and voting problems , that isn\u2019t the same as fraud.\nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it had received no allegation of fraud and the state Division of Elections said with respect to Broward \"our staff has seen no evidence of criminal activity at this time.\" The state's election office had been monitoring Broward\u2019s elections due to an unrelated lawsuit about prematurely destroyed ballots that Snipes lost after the 2016 election.\nState election officials have alerted federal prosecutors to possible election law violations. So far, the state appears to be raising questions about the Florida Democratic Party, not county elections officials.\nPolitico reported that on Nov. 9, the state Division of Elections sent a letter to federal prosecutors related to a form intended to serve as an affidavit to cure defects in vote-by-mail. While Florida law says that voters must return the forms on the day before the election, supervisors in at least four counties including Broward received altered forms wrongly directing the voter to return the form by Nov. 8. A chain of emails between supervisors and the state indicated that the information about the wrong date appeared to come from the Florida Democratic Party. A party spokeswoman couldn\u2019t be reached by PolitiFact.\nDid a Democratic lawyer say a noncitizen should have the right to vote?\nScott said on Fox News that a Nelson lawyer \"said that a non-citizen should have the right to vote.\"\nA Trump campaign fundraising email made an even bolder claim, saying that Democrats in Florida \"fought to include votes from people who ARE NOT EVEN UNITED STATES CITIZENS.\"\nThis statement requires context; mainly, it pertains to comment about a single voter.\nThe Scott campaign sent a few lines of a transcript of the board meeting in which Susan Bucher, the Palm Beach elections supervisor, said a ballot was not counted because the person was \"not a U.S. citizen.\" Lawyer Jack Scarola said \"objection Nelson\" followed by a similar objection by a lawyer for Gillum.\nScarola, a volunteer lawyer for Nelson, told us his objection was a joke.\n\"Everybody present recognized the fact there was no legal basis for raising an objection to a non-citizen casting a ballot,\" Scarola said in an interview. \"We had been there for hours, raising many objections based upon a variety of other issues and this objection was raised and understood by the canvassing board and everyone present to have been raised in humor.\"\nScarola said in another instance, the board rejected an unsigned ballot by a voter whose last name was DeSantis, the same name as GOP candidate for governor Ron DeSantis. Scarola said he \"raised a non-objection\" \u2014 another joke.\nNelson's lead recount attorney, Marc Elias, said in a statement to the media that the lawyer at the meeting was \"not someone we had authorized to make such an objection. Non-citizens cannot vote in U.S. elections.\"\nVotes cast by non-citizens are statistically rare .\nWhy were there 25,000 fewer votes for Senate than governor in Broward?\nIt is not in dispute that there were about 25,000 fewer votes for Senate than governor in Broward County. But there is not a definitive answer as to why this occurred. Voters are allowed to skip any races they want on the ballot. But it is odd that Broward stands out here.\nNelson\u2019s attorney suggested it could have been an issue with voting machines.\n\"The scanning equipment may not have caught it,\" Elias said.\nBut most of the theories relate to the ballot design in Broward, raising questions about whether some voters simply missed it. The Senate race question was placed in the same vertical column as the long list of voter instructions.\nThe U.S. Election Assistance Commission recommends ballot instructions be \"self-contained and separated from contest data.\"\nThe guidelines continue, \"Vertical instruction treatments cannot share column space with contests,\" noting that test voters often overlooked races listed under vertical instructions.\nDemocratic consultant Matthew Isbell found that 3.7 percent of Senate ballot questions were left blank in Broward, \"shattering any other county\u2019s undervote.\"\n\"My theory is that the lack of a congressional race meant there was one less opportunity to spot that races existed on the bottom left,\" Isbell wrote.\nDid tens of thousands of votes mysteriously show up after Election Day?\nScott and Trump have raised questions about why tens of thousands of votes showed up after Election Day.\nThe Tampa Bay Times found that Nelson\u2019s vote total between 11 p.m. on election night and the following Friday rose by 93,475.\nBut it\u2019s not a mystery. In the days following an election, vote totals normally go up. The Senate race\u2019s post-Election Day ballot count garnered particular attention because the totals were close as Scott\u2019s lead dwindled to about 13,000, prompting a recount.\nFlorida law allows until noon the Saturday after the election for ballots to be counted, and votes counted after the election were cast for both Nelson and Scott .\nWhat is Brenda Snipes\u2019 political affiliation?\nThe Broward County elections supervisor is a lifelong Democrat. Her biography on the Broward County supervisor of elections website also lists her as a Democrat. Numerous media\nreports and government documents confirm her Democratic party affiliation.\nThe party confusion probably stems from her 2003 appointment to the office by then-Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican . Bush has now called for her to be removed from office following the recounts.\nWere there more votes cast in Broward than registered voters?\nNo. Claims that there were more ballots cast than the number of registered voters are not supported by any evidence. Voter turnout in Broward County was about 61 percent, not 110 percent as some social media users claimed.\nThere have been 714,859 votes counted in Broward County so far, not more than 1.2 million.\nhttps:\/\/www.sharethefacts.co\/share\/638a2dae-8721-44ec-87c6-b32af6a22608\nRelated rulings:\nSays \"Brenda Snipes in Broward County is a Republican.\"\n\u2014 Andrea Mitchell, Monday, November 12th, 2018.\n\"Nearly 200,000 Florida voters may not be citizens.\"\n\u2014 Donald Trump Jr., Monday, November 12th, 2018.\n\"Democrats and their allies (...) are manufacturing voters.\"\n\u2014 Ken Blackwell, Friday, November 9th, 2018.\n\"#Broward elections department has a history of violating the law.\"\n\u2014 Marco Rubio, Thursday, November 8th, 2018.\nSee related rulings\nx\nTHE FACTS\nDelivered to your inbox weekly\nEmail Address\nSIGN UP\n"}]}

(AP Photo\/Brynn Anderson)\nBroward County supervisor of elections Brenda Snipes has found herself at the center of the election recount in Florida, where three statewide races remain undecided more than a week after Election Day.\nAs the high-stakes recount has proceeded, Snipes has been maligned as a Democratic partisan who\u2019s working to hand the election to her party.\nThere\u2019s no evidence of voter fraud or criminal activity. And according to NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell, the notion that Snipes is trying to engineer a victory for Democrats is even more off-base because, as Mitchell claimed, Snipes is a Republican .\n\"We should also point out that Brenda Snipes in Broward County is a Republican appointed by former governor, then-Gov. Jeb Bush,\" Mitchell said Nov. 12. \"So she was put in by a Republican governor after the mess that we all remember from 2000. And she\u2019s hardly a Democratic official, or someone doing the bidding of the Democratic candidates there.\"\nMitchell is wrong about Snipes\u2019 party affiliation: She\u2019s a Democrat. But, again, it\u2019s important to note we\u2019ve seen no evidence Snipes has done anything untoward on her party\u2019s behalf during the Florida recount.\nSnipes: \u2018I have been a Democrat all my life\u2019\nMitchell is apparently not the only person confused about Snipes\u2019 political affiliation.\nIn an interview with CNN , Snipes said she recently corrected someone who mistakenly believed she was a Republican:\n\"I was talking with a woman today, as she came into our office, and she made some statement \u2014 a partisan statement \u2014 and she said, \u2018I know that you\u2019re a Republican.\u2019 I said, \u2018I have been a Democrat all my life.\u2019 In this position, I have been very focused on party, because I want to treat all of the voters in Broward County the same. And I think if you\u2019d ask the voters, I have that reputation.\"\nAt look at Snipes\u2019 biography on the Broward County supervisor of elections website also lists her as a Democrat.\nCountless media reports also refer to Snipes\u2019 Democratic affiliation. To take just one example, here\u2019s an article from the South Florida Sun Sentinel about Snipes\u2019 2016 re-election bid, which references her party affiliation.\n\"Snipes, a Democrat, was appointed by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in 2003, after he removed her predecessor Miriam Oliphant,\" the 2015 article reads . \"Snipes went on to win three elections.\"\nSnipes went on to win the 2016 Democratic primary by a whopping 53 percentage points .\nPolitiFact also referenced Snipes\u2019 Democratic affiliation in a fact-check we wrote during the 2016 presidential election.\nWe attempted to reach Mitchell through a press contact for her NBC show but did not hear back.\nOur ruling\nMitchell said Snipes is a Republican.\nThat\u2019s wrong.

Neither the White House nor Department of Homeland Security responded to queries on whether Trump planned to advance this campaign promise.\nAttempts to fulfill the promise likely would have faced legal and logistical challenges. People admitted under a refugee status \u2014 from Syria or elsewhere \u2014 are not in the country illegally upon arrival. Refugees must also apply for a green card one year after coming to the United States. A green card gives them lawful permanent residence.\nIf a refugee commits a crime then he or she might be placed in removal proceedings, if the crime warrants it. But that's different from mass deportations of Syrian refugees.\nThere haven't been efforts to round-up Syrian refugees in order to deport them, said Betsy Fisher, policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project at the Urban Justice Center, which represents refugees in immigration proceedings.\n\"People in legal status cannot be mass deported,\" Fisher said.\nThere are also legal protections against sending people back to places where they fear persecution, Fisher said, adding that by virtue of being admitted into the United States as refugees, the United States has determined they have a well-founded fear.\nSince the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, it's estimated that about half a million people have been killed, more than 5.6 million people have sought refuge in other countries and around 6.6 million are internally displaced.\n\"While most Syrian refugees intend to return home, even in the best-case scenario, it will take several years for necessary conditions to be in place that would allow the majority to return in safety and dignity,\" said a February 2018 report from the United Nations' refugee agency.\nThe UN said it would eventually consider supporting government-organized repatriations of Syrians if certain protection thresholds were met. Among those requirements: the conclusion of a formal agreement with the Syrian government, host countries, and other actors as required, and ensuring that every individual's decision to return is \"informed and genuinely voluntary, without any coercion.\"\nFisher of the International Refugee Assistance Project said she was unaware of a repatriation agreement between the United States and Syria.\nTrump promised to remove Syrian refugees from the United States. That promise faces a major challenge: Syrian refugees are not in the country illegally. We've seen no action from the Trump administration to fulfill this promise. We rate it Promise Broken.\nSources:\nPhone interview, Betsy Fisher, policy director for the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP) at the Urban Justice Center, Nov. 13, 2018\nUNHCR, Comprehensive Protection And Solutions Strategy:Protection Thresholds And Parameters for Refugee Return To Syria , February 2018\nReuters, Exclusive: Despite tensions, Russia seeks U.S. help to rebuild Syria , Aug. 3, 2018\nEleven-year-old Omran Wawieh, a refugee from Syria, is staying with parents and siblings at a motel in Pomona, Calif., on Nov. 17, 2015. (Irfan Khan\/Los Angeles Times\/TNS)\nNo efforts yet from Trump administration for mass deportation of Syrian refugees\nBy Miriam Valverde on Thursday, June 15th, 2017 at 3:08 p.m.\nThrough executive orders, President Donald Trump has attempted to reduce the number of refugees to be admitted into the United States and to halt the entry of Syrian nationals.\nBut so far, he has not followed up on his promise to deport all Syrian refugees already in the country. Trump in September 2015 said that if he won the presidency, Syrian refugees would be \"going back.\" \nMore than 20,000 Syrian refugees have arrived in the United States since Oct. 1, 2011 (the beginning of fiscal year 2012), according to the latest data from the State Department's Refugee Processing Center. The Syrian civil war began in 2011.\nTo date, we have not seen any efforts from the Trump administration for a deportation of Syrian refugees. A Department of Homeland Security spokesman told us there are no directives to remove all Syrian refugees. \"However, individuals may be removed based on certain circumstances depending on their immigration status,\" David Lapan, DHS spokesman said.\nExperts who follow issues related to Syrian refugees also told us they had not seen any concerted efforts related to this campaign promise. \nRefugees admitted into the United States are legally present in the United States. They are required by law to apply for permanent resident status after living one year in the country. An immigration expert previously told us that the removal of Syrian refugees would have to be done on a case-by-case basis. Grounds for deportation include criminal misconduct or immigration violations.\nIf a refugee becomes a naturalized U.S. citizen based on materially fraudulent information, they could be stripped of citizenship and put in removal proceedings, said Denise Bell, senior campaigner for refugee and migrant rights for Amnesty International USA. \nWe asked the White House press office if the president was still planning to follow through on this pledge. We did not get a response.\nPending action from the Trump administration to remove all Syrian refugees, we rate this promise Stalled.\nSources:\nSyrian refugees arrival data, State Department's Refugee Processing Center, accessed June 14, 2017\nEmail interview, David Lapan, spokesman for Department of Homeland Security, June 14, 2017\nEmail statement, Denise Bell, Amnesty International USA, June 13, 2017\nTrump\u2019s abilities to remove existing refugees are limited\nBy Miriam Valverde on Monday, January 16th, 2017 at 3:09 p.m.\nDonald Trump campaigned for president on a firm stance against taking in more Syrian refugees, expressing distrust in the vetting process and concern that among those admitted into the United States, there may be terrorists.\nTaking it a step further, he said that if he made it to the White House, he would remove existing Syrian refugees from the country.\n\"I'm putting the people on notice that are coming here from Syria, as part of this mass migration, that if I win, if I win, they're going back,\" Trump said Sept. 30, 2015. They're going back. I'm telling you. They're going back.\"\nWHY HE'S PROMISING IT\nDespite a rigorous vetting process already in place for refugees \u2014 which can take up to two years \u2014 Trump claimed \"we have no idea\" who is coming in.\n\"There's no identification, there's no anything,\" Trump said during a campaign rally in New Hampshire in September 2015.\nRefugees could be ISIS terrorists, Trump said at that rally.\n\"Because you know, military tactics are very interesting. This could be one of the great tactical ploys of all time, 200,000-man army, maybe, or if you said 50,000 or 80,000 or 100,000, we got problems. And that could be possible. I don't know that it is, but it could be possible,\" Trump said. \"So they're going back. They're going back \u2026 And I know a lot of people are saying, 'well, that's not nice.' We can't afford to be nice. We're taking care of the whole world.\"\nWHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN\nTo fulfill his promise, Trump would need to remove about 15,000 people.\nFrom 2012 to the end of fiscal year 2015 (Sept. 30, 2015), the United States admitted slightly more than 1,800 Syrian refugees . In fiscal year 2016, the United States accepted about 13,000 Syrian refugees .\nIn comparison to other countries such as Canada and Germany, the United States accepted few Syrian refugees during the first years of the Syrian civil war.\nHOW MUCH WILL IT COST\nTrump has not said how much it would cost to remove Syrian refugees.\nRefugees are not in the country illegally. However, the cost of arresting, detaining and removing an undocumented immigrant was pegged at $12,500 in 2011 by a U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement official.\nWHAT'S STANDING IN HIS WAY\nDespite his promise, Trump's abilities to remove existing refugees are limited.\n\"There is no legal authority for the president to remove Syrian refugees or anyone else from the United States unless the particular individual falls within one of the specific deportation grounds prescribed by Congress,\" said Stephen Legomsky, professor emeritus at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis and a former chief counsel at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nAn individual may be deportable on grounds of criminal misconduct, national security, public health or various immigration violations, Legomsky said.\nRefugees are legally present in the United States and are required by law to apply for permanent resident status after being in the country for one year. They can apply for U.S. citizenship after being a resident for five years.\nPOSSIBLE TIMELINE\nRemoval of Syrian refugees would have to be done on a case-by-case basis, if the individual is convicted of certain criminal activity, endangers public safety or national security, or commits other violations.\nSources:\nAt a campaign rally in Keene, N.H.\nAdvertisement\nHow to contact us\nEmail comments and suggestions for fact-checks to [email protected] or find us on Facebook ,and\nTwitter .

You may have been and not even know it! Use Gov. Mike Huckabee\u2019s handy guide to the secret mating ritual used by all homosexuals and be sure next time. You\u2019re welcome!\nAlthough the specific origins of the \u201Csecret handshake\u201D image are unknown, it had been circulating on the Internet since at least 2006. One of the earliest instances of its reproduction appeared on the Naked Authors\nblog , in an article about a writer\u2019s struggle to get published. At that time, the image was simply described as showing a secret handshake, not a secret \u201Chomosexual\u201D handshake:\nThe image became associated with homosexuals when it was reposted by the satirical Landover Baptist\nweb site in a \u201CGay Pride Action Alert\u201D that urged readers to \u201CCall a Baptist Pastor Immediately If You\u2019ve Experienced the Following Secret Invitation.\u201D The image was amended yet again to include Governor Mike Huckabee when it was posted to Facebook page of Mrs. Betty Bowers.\nThe \u201CMrs. Betty Bowers, America\u2019s Best Christian\u201D Facebook page is not clearly identified as satire, but those familiar with the satirical Landover Baptist Church web site will recognize Betty Bowers as one of that site\u2019s fictional creations.\nBy\nDan Evon\nPublished\n4 February 2015\nFiled Under\nmike huckabee , Not Necessarily The News\nDear Reader,\nSnopes.com has long been engaged in the battle against misinformation, an effort we could not sustain without support from our audience.

They are TV addict rednecks who occasionally feed Johnny and yell at him for making noise. Johnny\u2019s only company in the basement is his little dog.
